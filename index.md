**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**\
The most interesting topic that I've looked at when reading independent articles was how important features are created in achieving a robust and well-rounded model. More specifically, when reading an article looking at children's causes of asthma, instead of using singular air toxics to identify the causes of early on-set asthma (as I assumed they would), they took the extra step of using combinations of multiple air toxics as features which were never explored before. This stressed how important it is to think of unique features when creating a model.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**\
A potential investigation I would like to pursue for my quarter 2 project is analyzing early onset disease in children and exploring what factors can contribute to the disease and how it can be more easily identified through data science.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**\
Currently, we are looking into facial/emotion detection using previously created computer vision models. Our current datasets only include more grown-up faces and would like to change to look at children's faces (I assume that it'll be different in predicting children's faces as their structure may be different, especially for very young ages) 

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**\
I would love to explore more computer vision techniques that could be useful for my project and learn more about different existing models and how they work. I would also love to use some computer vision tools, such as OpenCV.
